The full R script for a Bayesian model of bacterial interactions in infant gut Microbiota

This study highlights the utility of Bayesian modeling in uncovering complex interactions within the infant gut microbiome, using a curated database of infant microbiome profiles and metadata and elucidating the influence of key factors such as birth mode, diet, and antibiotic treatments. By leveraging the power of Bayesian inference, we were able to incorporate prior knowledge, account for variability in bacterial taxa, and quantify the uncertainty in parameter estimates effectively. The application of a zero-inflated beta regression model allowed us to handle the unique characteristics of microbiome data, including its compositional and skewed nature.
The dataset used in this study comprised longitudinal data of bacterial abundances and associated metadata, including key variables such as birth mode, diet (breastfeeding status), and antibiotic treatment history. The bacterial taxa were identified and their relative abundances were quantified.
A Bayesian zero-inflated beta regression model was employed to explore the relationship between bacterial abundance and key covariates: birth mode, diet (breastfeeding status), and antibiotic treatment. Since this Bayesian model requires the response variable to be strictly within the range (0, 1), it normalized the abundance values by dividing them by their maximum value and adjusted boundary values of 0 and 1 to 0.001 and 0.999, respectively. The zero-inflated beta family was chosen
due to the nature of the abundance data, which included both continuous proportions and a significant proportion of zero values. This model was chosen for its ability to handle continuous proportional data with an excess of zeros, a common feature in microbiome studies. The model was specified with a fixed effects structure for the covariates (birth mode, diet, and antibiotic treatment) and a random effects term for bacterial taxa to account for inter-species variability. This random intercept allowed the model to capture the inherent variability among bacterial taxa, ensuring that the results reflected underlying biological processes rather than statistical artifacts. A zero-inflation parameter was also included to model the probability of zero observations, reflecting the sparsity of microbial data.
The model was implemented using the brms package in R, which provides an interface to the probabilistic programming language Stan. Model fitting was performed using four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, each with 8,000 iterations, of which the first 2,000 iterations were designated as the warm-up phase to allow the chains to stabilize. Convergence diagnostics, including the Å˜ statistic, were assessed to ensure proper mixing of the chains and reliable posterior sampling. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were summarized to obtain estimates of the fixed effects (birth mode, diet, and antibiotic treatment) and the variability attributable to random effects (bacterial taxa). We also assessed the influence of each covariate on bacterial abundance by visualizing marginal effects and credible intervals. Trace plots were generated to confirm the convergence of the MCMC chains and to inspect sampling behavior.
All computations were carried out in R, and the resulting model, diagnostics, and visualizations were saved to ensure reproducibility.
